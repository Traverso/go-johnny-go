### Browser based UI to manage Johnny Five animations

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Traverso/go-johnny-go/master/docs/ui.png">

**Go-Johnny-Go is a web based user interface to create and manage animations to be used with the [Johnny-Five Robotics Programming Framework](http://johnny-five.io)**

Johnny-Five has very powerful [animations capabilities](http://johnny-five.io/api/animation/)
but describing keyFrames and cue positions for a lot of servos in code, can be a bit tiring.

Go-Johnny-Go allows you to create and edit animation segments using a browser base user interface.
